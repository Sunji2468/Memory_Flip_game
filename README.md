# Memory_Flip_game
This is a fun and interactive memory game where players flip cards to find matching panda images. The game keeps track of your moves, matches, and time, and rewards you with a celebration when you match them all!
I also used AI to help me debug the game logic, the timer, scoring, and card interactions. I also used AI suggestions to improve the visual layout with backgrounds and responsive design techniques that make the game more engaging.
